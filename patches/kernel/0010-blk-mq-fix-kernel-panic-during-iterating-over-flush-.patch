Subject: [PATCH] blk-mq: fix kernel panic during iterating over flush request

commit c2da19ed50554ce52ecbad3655c98371fe58599f upstream.

For fixing use-after-free during iterating over requests, we grabbed
request's refcount before calling ->fn in commit 2e315dc07df0 ("blk-mq:
grab rq->refcount before calling ->fn in blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter").
Turns out this way may cause kernel panic when iterating over one flush
request:

1) old flush request's tag is just released, and this tag is reused by
one new request, but ->rqs[] isn't updated yet

2) the flush request can be re-used for submitting one new flush command,
so blk_rq_init() is called at the same time

3) meantime blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter() is called, and old flush request
is retrieved from ->rqs[tag]; when blk_mq_put_rq_ref() is called,
flush_rq->end_io may not be updated yet, so NULL pointer dereference
is triggered in blk_mq_put_rq_ref().

Fix the issue by calling refcount_set(&flush_rq->ref, 1) after
flush_rq->end_io is set. So far the only other caller of blk_rq_init() is
scsi_ioctl_reset() in which the request doesn't enter block IO stack and
the request reference count isn't used, so the change is safe.

Fixes: 2e315dc07df0 ("blk-mq: grab rq->refcount before calling ->fn in blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter")
